SteamGames ML OPS is one of the final integrative projects of the Henry Data-Science Bootcamp. The project revolves around the SteamGames datasets, which cover information about games, users and developers from the Steam platform. The main goal of this project was to transform the raw data into a clean, well-organized and optimized format. Subsequently, the data was analyzed and used to train a machine learning model for a recommendation system and to be consumed according to specific queries as endpoints of an API.
